# üß± Microservices Architecture with FastAPI

A scalable, production-ready Python microservices architecture using FastAPI, modern tooling, and cloud-native best practices.

---

## üîß Core Technology Stack

### Web Framework
- **FastAPI**  
  High-performance web framework with async support and automatic OpenAPI documentation. Ideal for microservices.

### Database
- **PostgreSQL** with SQLAlchemy / asyncpg for relational data.
- **Redis** for caching and session storage.
- (Optional) **MongoDB** for document-based data storage.

### Messaging & Eventing
- **RabbitMQ** or **Apache Kafka** for asynchronous, decoupled communication between services.

### Service Discovery
- **Consul** or **etcd** for dynamic service registration and discovery.

### API Gateway
- **Kong**, **Traefik**, or build one with **FastAPI** for routing, rate-limiting, and authentication.

## üß± Architecture Patterns

- **Repository Pattern**  
  Decouples business logic from database operations.

- **Dependency Injection**  
  Use FastAPI‚Äôs built-in system to manage dependencies cleanly.

- **Circuit Breaker**  
  Improve fault tolerance using the `circuitbreaker` library.

- **Event Sourcing** *(optional)*  
  Useful for tracking state changes in complex workflows.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Configuration Files

- `docker-compose.yml`  
  Local development setup including services and infrastructure.

- `kubernetes/`  
  Helm charts or raw manifests for production deployment.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development Workflow

- Use **Poetry** or **pip-tools** for dependency management.
- Apply **pre-commit** hooks with:
  - `black` (code formatting)
  - `isort` (import sorting)
  - `flake8` (linting)
  - `mypy` (type checking)
- Set up CI/CD with **GitHub Actions** or **GitLab CI**.
- Use **Docker multi-stage builds** to create small, production-ready images.

---

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

- **OpenTelemetry** for distributed tracing.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for centralized logging.
- **Prometheus + Grafana** for metrics and dashboards.

---

## üß† Why This Structure?

This setup follows enterprise-level best practices:

### ‚úÖ Scalability
Each microservice can be scaled and deployed independently.

### ‚úÖ Maintainability
Clean separation between layers and shared libraries reduces complexity.

### ‚úÖ Testability
Supports unit, integration, and end-to-end testing strategies.

### ‚úÖ Developer Experience
Consistent layout, tooling, and patterns speed up onboarding and reduce confusion.

### ‚úÖ Production-Readiness
Includes monitoring, security practices, deployment configs, and config management.

## üêç Python Standards

- **FastAPI** for APIs
- **Pydantic** for schema validation
- **SQLAlchemy** for ORM
- **pyproject.toml** for clean dependency tracking
- **Shared libraries** to reuse code while keeping services decoupled
